Step1: To check enough run file included: 
        Optimization_by_linear_regression_based_gradient_derivation.py
        SGD_based_Optimization_by_linear_regression.py
        Visualize_input_data_for_analyze.py

Step2: Visualize input data by file "Visualize_input_data_for_analyze.py" . This need to be run for analysis
Step3: Run file  "SGD_based_Optimization_by_linear_regression.py"
Step4: To attach data path by the file format as .csv
Step5: Training model and get result

Note: For this method, we call linear because it based on first degree function. we can use for ^2 ^3 ^n, by the way create more features....
